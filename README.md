# Smile-Face-Glasses-Detection

Smile face and glasses detection with deep convolutional neural networks, on [GENKI4K](https://inc.ucsd.edu/mplab/398/) dataset.

This is the repo of the course **CBU5201 Machine Learning **mini-project coursework.

*The mini-project has two separate components:*

1. **Basic component** [6 marks]: Using the `genki4k` dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input an image and predicts 1) whether the person in the image is smiling or not 2) estimate the 3D head pose labels in the image.
2. **Advanced component** [10 marks]: Formulate your own machine learning problem and build a machine learning solution using the `genki4k` dataset 

The coursework consist of two `Jupyter` notebooks, one for the basic component and another one for advanced component:

* **CBU5201_miniproject_basic.ipynb**

* **CBU5201_miniproject_advanced.ipynb**

Each notebook includes: 

1. *Text cells*, describing concisely each step and results.

2. *Code cells*, implementing each step.

3. *Output cells*, i.e. the output from each code cell.

#### **Here are some results !!:**
